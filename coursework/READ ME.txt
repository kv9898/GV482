The database contains the following variables:

- Country (3 letters abbreviation)

- Year 

- Total vote share for left-wing populist parties
The data are from Timbro (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6AktPr-jRK5vRh7_owPvED96EqmKfUdjKFX9wiZMI4/edit#gid=0)
Data are for legislative elections.
When a country uses a two-round system, first-round results are used.
Countries CAN have multiple elections in a year.

- Total vote share for right-wing populist parties
Same comment as for left-wing populists

- Election date
Variable stating the date of the election. If two-round elections, first-round date is considered. If elections are held over two days, 
later date is considered.

- Terrorist data
Data on all attacks are taken from the Global Terrorism Database
Data on Islamist attacks are taken from the Fondation Pour l'Innovation Politique
The data are available here: https://data.fondapol.org/en/non-classe-en/islamist-terrorist-attacks-in-the-world-1979-2019-2/
Data on left-wing and right-wing terrorism have been hand-coded in two steps: (1) When the terrorist group carrying the attack
is known, the group has been classified left or right (see file here where a value of one designates a left-wing group and a 
value of zero a right-wing group: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/quj8g1pcaexymx2njukhd/LeftRightTerrorism.xlsx?rlkey=6voln1s89m46lybw70enduns0&dl=0)
(2) when the group is unknown, classification has been done by looking at the motive of the attack (more details available by email if needed).
All data are aggregated yearly relative to the election date for each country.
Attacks look at the number of attacks for all terrorist attacks
nkill look at the number of killed citizens for all terrorist attacks
nwound look at the number of wounded citizens for all terrorist attacks
leftproxy rightproxy are the number of attacks by left-wing and right-wing groups/individuals, respectively 
nkill_left nwound_left nkill_right nwound_right are the number of deaths and wounded linked to groups with left-wing/right-wing ideology
IslClaim are all attacks claimed by Islamist movements as categorized by the Fondation Pour l'Innovation Politique
IslPoss are all attacks which can be attributed to Islamist movements as categorized by the Fondation Pour l'Innovation Politique
nkill_Isl* and nwound_Isl* are the number of deaths and wounded linked to the different type of Islamist attacks
Home* means attacks that happen in the country where the election is held Y1 to Y4 indicate the number of years to election
(e.g., Y1 means that the attacks/n death/ n wounded are in the year to the election (in the 365 days prior to the election in X))
You also have attacks in other countries which took place in the years prior to the election in country X. 
The name of these variables have three components: variable type, country attacked, year(s) prior to election
(e.g., AttacksITAY1 captures the attacks who took place in Italy in the year prior to the election in country X
nkillICEY3 captures the number of killed in Iceland in the third year (1095 days to 730 days) prior to the election in country X) 

- Language
The language similarity measures are taken from the dataset prepared by Toubal and Melitz, introduced in their Journal of International
Economics paper (2014).
The dataset is available here: http://faridtoubal.com/Paper/LangJIE/lang.html
Three measures can be used: prox1, prox2, and cle which are described on pages 354-355 of their article
Note that there is no data for Serbia and Montenegro. Belgium and Luxembourg are also equivalent in the data so they have similar indices
A variable name has two components: type of variable (prox1, prox2, cle) + comparison country


- Border
Comes from https://www.geodatasource.com  
The dummy takes a value of one if country X borders the country listed under the variable Country
Note that a country is not considered as bordering itself (e.g., the variable BorderAUT has a value of 0 for country AUT, 
the variable BorderUK has a value of 0 for country UK).
Only neighbors included in the dataset are considered (e.g., Ukraine is not considered though it borders Poland for example).
BorderITA, for example, would take value 1 if a country borders Italy and 0 otherwise 

- Cultural similarity
The cultural similarity index is constructed using the data from Michalopoulos and Xue's paper "Folklore" published in the QJE
The paper compute the number of tales containing certain motifs (23 different motifs in total). We use the country level data (MTurk_countries.dta)
Two index are computed: 1) normalised_culturalsimilarity uses the number of tales using the motifs normalised
2) percent_culturalsimilarity use the percentage of tales using a motif per country.
In both cases, a difference index is computed by taking the average distance over each motif. A similarity index corresponds to one minus the difference 
A variable name, like above, has two components: the similarity index used + the abbreviation of the comparison country

- Unemployment, etc. are a set of possible controls
Percentage are expressed in percent (so 9 would mean 9%)
Economic variables are expressed in millions euros
