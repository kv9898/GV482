# Part III - The Populist's entry decision (part of this will be solved on Thursday 2 February, the rest on Thursday 9 February)

In the previous part, we have computed the electoral decision of a voter from group $C$ as a function of her information. We use our previous answers to compute $P$'s electoral chances and entry decision under different scenarios.

## Q7

In this question, we suppose that mainstream candidates find it optimal to the commoners' preferred policy.

(a) Using your answers to **Q3**, explain briefly why $P$ never wins the election if he enters in this case.

    \color{blue}

    As we have shown in **Q3**, the probability of $P$ winning the election is $0$ if he enters.

    If $P$ proposes the same platform (commoners' preferred policy) as $A$ and $B$, $P$ will get no vote as both the commoners and elite will vote for the mainstream candidate with a positive valence shock. This corresponds to **Q3** (a).

    If $P$ proposes a different platform, and

    -   the commoners and the elite's preferred policy is the same, $P$ will get no vote as both the commoners and elite will vote for the mainstream candidate with a positive valence shock. This corresponds to **Q3** (b).

    -   the commoners and the elite's preferred policy is different, $P$ will only get the elite's votes. This accounts for $\sigma$ of the vote. Since this is less than 50%, $P$ will not win the election. This corresponds to **Q3** (c).

    \color{black}

(b) Explain why the populist never enters when $\sigma+(1+\sigma)(1−p)<\frac{1}{2}$.

    \color{blue}

    As we have shown in **Q2** (e), $\sigma+(1+\sigma)(1−p)<\frac{1}{2}$ implies that the mainstream candidates converge on the commoners preferred policy. As we discussed in Part (a), $P$ has no chance of winning in this case. As there is a cost to entry, $P$ will not enter:

    $$
    U_P(\text{enter})=-c<U_P(\text{not enter})=0
    $$

    \color{black}

## Q8

In question [Q8] and [Q9], we turn to the case when mainstream candidates converge to the elite citizens' preferred policy ($x_A = x_B = \omega_E$ and this is anticipated by commoners). In this question, we assume that $\alpha > 1/2$ and look at $P$'s entry decision then.

(a) Assume that mainstream candidates propose $x_A=x_B=0$ and the populist offers $x_P =1$. Assume further than the state is $\omega_C = 0$ (i.e., that is the optimal policy happens to be zero for the common voters). Using your answer to **Q5**(i), show that the vote share of candidate $P$ is: $(1 − \sigma)(1 − p)$. Explain why P does not win the election then.

    \color{blue}

    The elite know their preference well. They will vote for one of the maintream candidates and not populist $P$.

    As for the commoners,

    -   some receive signal of 1 ($s_{i,C}=1$). Their posterior belief (from **Q5** (j)) is:

        $$
        \mu(1,0,0,1)=\frac{(1-\alpha)p^2}{(1-\alpha)p^2+\alpha(1-p)^2}>\frac{1+|\delta|}{2}.
        $$

        They will vote for $P$.

    -   Some receive signal of 0 ($s_{i,C}=0$). Their posterior belief is:

        $$
        \mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha
        $$

        Since we assume $\alpha>1/2$, $\mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha<\frac{1}{2}<\frac{1=|\delta|}{2}$. They will not vote for $P$.

    Therefore, only the commoners who receive signal of 1 will vote for $P$. The probability of receiving this wrong signal $Pr(s_{i,C}=1\mid \omega_C=0)=1-p$. They therefore account for $(1-\sigma)(1-p)$ of total voters. Since $p>0.5$, this is smaller than 50%. Other voters will unite around the mainstream candidate with a positive valence shock, who will receive more than 50% of the vote. Therefore, $P$ will not win the election.

    \color{black}

(b) Assume that mainstream candidates propose $x_A=x_B=0$ and the populist offers $x_P =1$. Assume further than the state is $\omega_C = 1$ (i.e., that is the optimal policy happens to be one for the common voters). Show that the vote share of candidate P is: $(1 − \sigma)p$. Explain why $P$ loses the election then.

    \color{blue}

    The elite know their preference well. They will vote for one of the maintream candidates and not populist $P$.

    As for the commoners,

    -   some receive signal of 1 ($s_{i,C}=1$). Their posterior belief (from **Q5** (j)) is:

        $$
        \mu(1,0,0,1)=\frac{(1-\alpha)p^2}{(1-\alpha)p^2+\alpha(1-p)^2}>\frac{1+|\delta|}{2}.
        $$

        They will vote for $P$.

    -   Some receive signal of 0 ($s_{i,C}=0$). Their posterior belief is:

        $$
        \mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha
        $$

        Since we assume $\alpha>1/2$, $\mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha<\frac{1}{2}<\frac{1+|\delta|}{2}$. They will not vote for $P$.

    Therefore, only the commoners who receive signal of 1 will vote for $P$. The probability of receiving this right signal $Pr(s_{i,C}=1\mid \omega_C=1)=p$. They therefore account for $(1-\sigma)p$ of total voters. For the mainstream candidates to converge on the elite's preference, it requires:

    ```{=tex}
    \begin{align*}
    \sigma+(1-\sigma)(1-p)&\geq\frac{1}{2} \\
    \sigma+(1-\sigma)-(1-\sigma)p&\geq\frac{1}{2} \\
    (1-\sigma)p&\leq\frac{1}{2}
    \end{align*}
    ```
    Therefore, $P$ only receives less than half of the votes, whereas the mainstream candidate with a positive valence shock gathers more than half of the votes. $P$ therefore loses.

    \color{black}

(c) Assume that mainstream candidates propose $x_A = x_B = 1$ and the populist offers $x_P = 0$. Explain why P never wins the election.

    \color{blue}

    The elite know their preference well. They will vote for one of the maintream candidates and not populist $P$.

    As for the commoners,

    -   some receive signal of 1 ($s_{i,C}=1$). Their posterior belief (from **Q6** (a)) is:

        $$
        \mu(1,1,1,0)=\alpha.
        $$

        As we have shown in **Q6** (d), commoners with signal 1 in this case only vote for $P$ if and only if $\alpha<1/2$. As we assume $\alpha>1/2$ in this question, they will not vote for $P$.

    -   Some receive signal of 0 ($s_{i,C}=0$). Their posterior belief is:

        $$
        \mu(0,1,1,0)=\frac{(1-p)^2\alpha}{(1-p)^2\alpha+p^2(1-\alpha)}
        $$

        As we have shown in **Q6** (d), commoners with signal 0 in this case always vote for $P$.

    Therefore, only commoners with signal 0 will vote for $P$. The probability of receiving this signal is either $p$ or $1-p$. They therefore account for $(1-\sigma)p$ or $(1-\sigma)(1-p)$ of total voters. As we explored in Part (c), neither is greater than 50% and one of the mainstream candidates gathers the majority of the vote. Therefore, $P$ will not win the election.

    \color{black}

(d) Explain briefly why P never enters.

    \color{blue}

    We have shown that, when $\alpha>1/2$, the populist candidate $P$ never wins the election. No matter which policy the mainstream candidates converge on and what policy the populist candidate $P$ proposes, she has no chance of winning. Since there is a cost of running for election, $P$ will never enter the election.

    \color{black}

## Q9

We now look at $P$'s electoral chances and entry decision when $\alpha<1/2$.

(a) Assume that mainstream candidates propose $x_A=x_B=0$ and the populist offers $x_P=1$. Using your answer to **Q5**(i), show that the vote share of candidate $P$ is: ($1 − \sigma$). Explain why $P$ wins the election then.

    \color{blue}

    The elite will also vote for the mainstream candidates as their platform aligns with the elite's preference.

    As for the commoners,

    -   some receive signal of 1 ($s_{i,C}=1$). Their posterior belief (from **Q5** (j)) is:

        $$
        \mu(1,0,0,1)=\frac{(1-\alpha)p^2}{(1-\alpha)p^2+\alpha(1-p)^2}>\frac{1+|\delta|}{2}.
        $$

        They will vote for $P$.

    -   Some receive signal of 0 ($s_{i,C}=0$). Their posterior belief is:

        $$
        \mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha
        $$

        Since we assume $\alpha<1/2$, $\mu(0,0,0,1)=1-\alpha>\frac{1+|\delta|}{2}$. This is shown in **Q5** (j). They will also vote for $P$.

    Therefore, the $P$ will enjoy all the votes, and only the votes of the commoners, who account for ($1-\sigma$) of all voters. Since there are more commoners than elite $1-\sigma>1/2$, $P$ will win the election.

    \color{black}

(b) Assume that mainstream candidates propose $x_A=x_B=1$ and the populist offers $x_P=0$. Explain why $P$ always wins the election then.

    \color{blue}

    The elite will also vote for the mainstream candidates as their platform aligns with the elite's preference.

    As for the commoners,

    -   some receive signal of 1 ($s_{i,C}=1$). Their posterior belief (from **Q6** (a)) is:

        $$
        \mu(1,1,1,0)=\alpha.
        $$

        As we have shown in **Q6** (d), $\mu(1,1,1,0)=\alpha<\frac{1-|\delta|}{2}$ when $\alpha<1/2$ and these commoners with signal of 1 will vote for $P$.

    -   some receive signal of 0 ($s_{i,C}=0$). Their posterior belief is:

        $$
        \mu(0,1,1,0)=\frac{(1-p)^2\alpha}{(1-p)^2\alpha+p^2(1-\alpha)}
        $$

        We have shown in **Q6** (d) it is true that $\mu(0,1,1,0)<\frac{1-|\delta|}{2}$ for all values of $\alpha$. Therefore these commoners with signal of 1 will also vote for $P$.

    Therefore, the $P$ will enjoy all the votes, and only the votes of the commoners, who account for ($1-\sigma$) of all voters. Since there are more commoners than elite $1-\sigma>1/2$, $P$ will win the election.

We now need to compute $P$'s expected payoff if $P$ enters. We consider the populist's entry decision so we no longer assume that $x_P = s_{P,C}$ (this has to be a choice of the populist). However, we still assume below that citizens anticipate that $x_P = s_{P,C}$ if the populist enters (we will see that this anticipation is correct below). In turn, both the citizens and the populist anticipate that the mainstream candidates propose $x_A=x_B=\omega_E$ (again, we will see that this anticipation is correct in [Part IV - The mainstream parties' adaptation](#part-iv---the-mainstream-parties-adaptation)).

To calculate $P$'s expected utility when he enters, we make use of $\rho(s_{P,C}, x_A, x_B)$ the populist's posterior that $\omega_C = 1$ given his signal and the mainstream candidates' platform choices.

(c) Show that the expected payoff of the populist candidate if he enters the race is:
    -   $0 − c$ if $x_P = x_A = x_B$

        \color{blue}

        As we have shown previously, $P$ never wins the election if he enters with the same platform as the mainstream candidates, as voters will vote for the mainstream candidate with a positive valence shock.

        In this case, the populist gets 0 from losing an election and $-c$ from entering the race, hence $U_P(x_A=x_B)=0-c$.

        \color{black}

    -   $\rho(s_{P,C}, 0, 0) − c$ if $x_P = 1$ and $x_A = x_B = 0$

        \color{blue}

        When $x_A=x_B=0$, the posterior belief is $Pr(\omega_C=1\mid s_{P,C}, x_A=0, x_B=0)=\rho(s_{P,C},0,0)$.

        If she proposes $x_P=1$, all common voters will vote for her as $\alpha<1/2$. This is shown in **Q5** (j). This means she will certainly win.

        Nevertheless, other than winning, $P$ also cares about implementing the right policy for the people. The probability that she proposes the right policy ($x_P=\omega_C=1$) is $\rho(S_{P,C},0,0)$. Hence her expected payoff:

        $$
        =Pr(\text{right policy and win})\times1 -c=\rho(s_{P,C},0,0)-c.
        $$

        \color{black}

    -   $1 − \rho(s_{P,C}, 1, 1) − c$ if $x_P = 0$ and $x_A = x_B = 1$

        \color{blue}

        When $x_A=x_B=1$, the posterior belief is $Pr(\omega_C=1\mid s_{P,C}, x_A=1, x_B=1)=\rho(s_{P,C},1,1)$.

        If she proposes $x_P=0$, all common voters will vote for her as $\alpha<1/2$. This is shown in **Q6** (d). This means she will certainly win.

        Nevertheless, other than winning, $P$ also cares about implementing the right policy for the people. The probability that she proposes the right policy ($x_P=\omega_C=0$) is $1-\rho(S_{P,C},1,1)$. Hence her expected payoff:

        $$
        =Pr(\text{right policy and win})\times1 -c=1-\rho(s_{P,C},1,1)-c.
        $$

        \color{black}

Obviously, $P$ does not enter at the same platform as the mainstream candidates. To see, whether $P$ enters at a different platform, we need to compute $P$'s posterior (belief) that the correct policy for group $C$ is $x = 1$ after observing his own signal $s_{P,C}$ and the other candidates' platforms $x_A$ and $x_B$. Recall as well that we still assume that mainstream candidates' platform is the optimal policy for the elite.

By Bayes' rule,

$$
\rho(s_{P,C},x_A,x_B)=\frac{Pr(s_{P,C},x_A,x_B\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_C=1)}{Pr(s_{P,C},x_A,x_B\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_C=1)+Pr(s_{P,C},x_A,x_B\mid\omega_C=0)Pr(\omega_C=0)}
$$ We again take these terms in turn.

(d) Suppose that $x_A = x_B = 0$ (at this point, it should be clear, I hope, that this means that the mainstream candidates propose policy 0). Explain briefly why $Pr(s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0\mid\omega_C=1)=Pr(s_{P,C},\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1)$.

    \color{blue}

    This is because we assume in this question that the mainstream candidates converge to the elite's preference.

    \color{black}

(e) Suppose that $x_A = x_B = 0$. Explain why we can write: $$
    Pr(s_{P,C}, \omega_{E} = 0\mid\omega_{C} = 1) = Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C = 1)Pr(\omega_E = 0\mid\omega_C = 1)
    $$

    \color{blue}

    This is because, conditional on $\omega_C=1$, $s_{P,C}$ and $\omega_E$ are independent (not correlated). The former and latter are only correlated with $\omega_C$ and not with each other.

    \color{black}

(f) Suppose that $x_A = x_B = 0$. Show that

    1.  $Pr(s_{P,C}, \omega_E = 0\mid\omega_C = 1) = Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C = 1)(1 − \alpha)$

        \color{blue}

        ```{=tex}
        \begin{align*}
        =&Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1) \\
        =&Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)(1-\alpha)
        \end{align*}
        ```
        \color{black}

    2.  $Pr(s_{P,C}, \omega_E = 0\mid\omega_C = 0) =Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C = 1)\alpha$

        \color{blue}

        ```{=tex}
        \begin{align*}
        =&Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=0)Pr(\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=0) \\
        =&Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=0)\alpha
        \end{align*}
        ```
        \color{black}

    3.  $\rho(s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0)=\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)}{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)+Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C = 0)\alpha}$

        \color{blue}

        ```{=tex}
        \begin{align*}
        =&Pr(\omega_C=1\mid s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0) \\
        =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_C=1)}{Pr(s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_C=1)+Pr(s_{P,C},x_A=0,x_B=0\mid\omega_C=0)Pr(\omega_C=0)}\\
        =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C},\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1)}{Pr(s_{P,C},\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1)+Pr(s_{P,C},\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=0)}\\
        =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1)}{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)Pr(\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=1)+Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=0)Pr(\omega_E=0\mid\omega_C=0)}\\
        =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)(1-\alpha)}{Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=1)(1-\alpha)+Pr(s_{P,C}\mid\omega_C=0)\alpha}
        \end{align*}
        ```
        \color{black}

(g) Using the previous result, show that $$
    \rho(s_{P,C} = 1, x_A = 0, x_B = 0)=\frac{p(1-\alpha)}{p(1-\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}
    $$

    \color{blue}

    ```{=tex}
    \begin{align*}
    &\rho(s_{P,C} = 1, x_A = 0, x_B = 0) \\
    =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)}{Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)+Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C = 0)\alpha} \\
    =&\frac{p(1−\alpha)}{p(1−\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}
    \end{align*}
    ```
    \color{black}

    $$
    \rho(s_{P,C} = 0, x_A = 0, x_B = 0)=\frac{(1-p)(1-\alpha)}{(1-p)(1-\alpha)+p\alpha}
    $$

    \color{blue}

    \begin{align*} &\rho(s_{P,C} = 0, x_A = 0, x_B = 0) \\ =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)}{Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C=1)(1−\alpha)+Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C = 0)\alpha} \\ =&\frac{(1-p)(1-\alpha)}{(1-p)(1-\alpha)+p\alpha} 
    \end{align*}

    \color{black}

(h) Suppose now that $x_A = x_B = 1$. Show that $$
    \rho(s_{P,C} = 1, x_A = 1, x_B = 1)=\frac{p\alpha}{p\alpha+(1-p)(1-\alpha)}
    $$

    \color{blue}

    ```{=tex}
    \begin{align*}
    &\rho(s_{P,C} = 1, x_A = 1, x_B = 1) \\
    =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C=1)\alpha}{Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C=1)\alpha+Pr(s_{P,C}=1\mid\omega_C = 0)(1-\alpha)} \\
    =&\frac{p\alpha}{p\alpha+(1-p)(1-\alpha)}
    \end{align*}
    ```
    \color{black}

    $$
    \rho(s_{P,C} = 0, x_A = 1, x_B = 1)=\frac{(1-p)\alpha}{(1-p)\alpha+p(1-\alpha)}
    $$

    \color{blue}

    \begin{align*} 
    &\rho(s_{P,C} = 0, x_A = 1, x_B = 1) \\ 
    =&\frac{Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C=1)\alpha}{Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C=1)\alpha+Pr(s_{P,C}=0\mid\omega_C = 0)(1-\alpha)} \\ 
    =&\frac{(1-p)\alpha}{(1-p)\alpha+p(1-\alpha)}
    \end{align*}

    \color{black}

Now that we know $P$'s belief about what the correct policy is, we can think about his entry decision.

(i) Recall that $1/2 < c < p$ and $1 − p < \alpha < p$. Show that when $x_A = x_B = 0$, the populist enters with platform $x_P = 1$ if and only if $s_{P,C} = 1$ and does not enter otherwise.

    \color{blue}

    We have shown that in this case the expected payoff of running for $P$ is:

    $$
    \rho(s_{P,C},0,0)-c.
    $$

    The two other options for $P$ are, entering with platform $x_P=0$, which gives expected payoff of

    $$
    1-\rho(s_{P,C},0,0)-c,
    $$

    and not running, which gives expected payoff of 0.

    When $s_{P,C}=1$,

    \begin{align*}
    \text{For}~&U_P(x_P=1)>U_P(x_P=0) \\
    \text{We need}~&\frac{p(1-\alpha)}{p(1-\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}-c>1-\frac{p(1-\alpha)}{p(1-\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}-c \\
    \text{which means}~&p(1-\alpha)-(1-p)\alpha>0. \\
    \text{This holds as the expression}&>p(1-p)-(1-p)p \\
    &=0
    \end{align*}

    \begin{align*}
    \text{For}~&U_P(x_P=1)>U_P(\text{}x_P=\phi)~\text{we need:} \\
    &\frac{p(1-\alpha)}{p(1-\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}-c-0>0 \\
    &\frac{(p-pc)(1-\alpha)-c(1-p)\alpha}{p(1-\alpha)+(1-p)\alpha}>0 \\
    &(p-pc)(1-\alpha)-c(1-p)\alpha>0.\\
    \text{Since}~&\alpha<1/2,~1-\alpha>\alpha\text{, we only need to prove:}\\
    &p-pc-c(1-p)>0\text{. Given}\\
    >&c-c^2-c(1-c) \\
    >&c-c^2-c+c^2=0\\
    \end{align*}

    This must be true. Therefore, when $s_{P,C}=1$ , $P$ enters with platform $x_P=1$.

    When $s_{P,C}=0$,

    \begin{align*}
    \text{For}~&U_P(x_P=1)>U_P(x_P=0) \\
    \text{We need}~&\frac{(1-p)(1-\alpha)}{(1-p)(1-\alpha)+p\alpha} -c>1-\frac{(1-p)(1-\alpha)}{(1-p)(1-\alpha)+p\alpha} -c \\
    \text{which means}~&(1-p)(1-\alpha)-p\alpha>0. \\
    \text{This does not hold as the expression}&<(1-p)p-p(1-p) \\
    &=0
    \end{align*}

    \begin{align*}
    \text{For}~&U_P(x_P=1)>U_P(\text{}x_P=\phi)~\text{we need:} \\

    Therefore, when $s_{P,C}=0$, entering with platform $x_P=1$ is dominated by the other two options and not chosen by $P$.

    Hence, when $x_A = x_B = 0$, the populist enters with platform $x_P = 1$ if and only if $s_{P,C} = 1$ and does not enter otherwise.

By a similar reasoning as above, we can also show that when $x_A = x_B = 1$, the populist enters with platform $x_P = 0$ if and only if $s_{P,C} = 0$ and does not enter otherwise (you are encouraged to check this yourself). With this in mind, we turn to the mainstream parties' adaptation under the threat of populist entry.
